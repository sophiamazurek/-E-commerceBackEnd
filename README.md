# E-Commerce Back End

  ## Description 
  In this project I focused using MySQL, MySQL Workbench, and Insomia. With using all three of these platforms I was able to build databases and connect them to eachother using routes. I used MySQL Workbench to add and drop databases and also show all of the data that was inbedded in my tables. 

  With Insomia, I used the functions GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE to show that I could retrieve data from my database. I woudl post all that data on insomia, put new data in, and then delete the data that I had created to go back to my orgional datatable.
